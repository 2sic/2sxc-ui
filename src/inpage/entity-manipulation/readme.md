# Entity Manipulation

Contains code to directly manipulate entities from the front end. 

This isn't much ATM, because almost all real manipulations happen through another GUI, 
so not directly from the front end. But if you do want the front-end to directly change 
an entity (like delete it), this is where the code should be.
