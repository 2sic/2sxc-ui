# 2sxc extensions

Put extension stuff here, which expands the $2sxc API with special commands only needed when logged in.

So these things will extend $2sxc, but only if the user has edit permissions

## Components

1. Consts - global constants needed in the entire application
1. System - contains global things like 2sxc installation code / events
