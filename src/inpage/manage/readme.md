# Manage: $2sxc.manage

This enhances any module-instance of $2sxc (so a $2sxc(node|moduleId)) with a `.manage` object when the user is logged in and can edit something on this module. 

The `.manage` controls all kinds of things that happen to this module, like

1. toolbar creation
1. action execution (new item, re-order, open-dialog whatever)
