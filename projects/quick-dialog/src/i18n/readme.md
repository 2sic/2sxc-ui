# Lanuguage / Translation files for the Quick-Dialog

These are JSON files, but stored as .js because some DNN sites won't let IIS deliver .json files.

In future, the build should rename the extension, but we haven't figured out how to do it in the angular-build.

For now when editing, pls rename to json, make changes and rename back.
