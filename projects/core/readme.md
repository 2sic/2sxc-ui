# Core Parts of the 2sxc JS Library

The core contains a few very central scripts relevant for many of the 2sxc projects. 

We could have placed them in an NPM package as well, but that would make it hard to keep the work in sync.

1. logging - logging system/framework used by many 2sxc JS systems
1. plumbing - some very simple object manipulation helpers
