# 2sxc TypeScript Typings 10.25.02

This are the public typings for NMP, which should help you write type-safe code when working with 2sxc JavaScript APIs.

Use this to create Angular, React, Vue etc. adaptors. 

We recommend to not use this API in the final SPAs and APPs, as the adapters should then provide an abstraction around this.

## Internal vs. External types

Internally, 2sxc has many other types, found in the folder /2sxc-api/js/. The types there extend the types found in /typings/src and are not meant for public use.
