# 2sxc TypeScript Typings

This is a pure typings repository, which should help you write type-safe code when working with 2sxc JavaScript APIs.

Use this to create Angular, React, Vue etc. adaptors. 

We recommend to not use this API in the final SPAs and APPs, as the adapters should then provide an abstraction around this.
